For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

Use icons from lucide-react for logos.

You are an AI full-stack web developer and DevOps engineer. Build a complete, deployable website project named **Algebrix.ai Beta**. Use the attached icon file named `algebrix-icon.png` as the site logo and favicon (if the file is not present, create a small placeholder icon and add a TODO comment to replace it with the provided icon). Deliver production-ready code and a README with Replit deployment instructions.

PROJECT GOALS
1. A modern responsive **Landing page** (marketing header, tagline, features, CTA).
2. A **Chat page / widget** where users chat with the Algebrix agent.
3. An **Agent task** endpoint and UI flow that:
   - Accepts a "topic".
   - Uses the Gemini free API (env var: `GEMINI_API_KEY_FREE`) to search the web.
   - Opens the top 5 results using Playwright (server-side), extracts each page `title` and the first meaningful paragraph (excerpt).
   - Saves results to a CSV with columns `{url,title,excerpt}` and returns a downloadable link.
   - Returns a concise summary (3–5 sentences) and the CSV link to the chat UI.
4. Math & step-by-step reasoning: the chat must be able to solve math/logic queries and present step-by-step solutions.
5. Safety rules: the agent will **never** request or use real account credentials, will **not** submit login forms or perform purchases, and will warn the user before interacting with pages requiring authentication.
6. Deployable to **Replit**. Include explicit steps to enable Playwright on Replit (install & run `playwright install`).

TECH STACK / FILES TO GENERATE
- Framework: **Next.js (React)** or a single-repo Node.js app served with Express if Bolt prefers. Use **Tailwind CSS** for styling (responsive, modern).
- Backend: Node/Express API routes (under `/api`) for:
  - `/api/chat` — conversational proxy to Gemini for chat and math answers.
  - `/api/agent` — runs the agent workflow: uses Gemini search, then Playwright for page extraction, writes CSV to `/public/outputs/{timestamp}-results.csv`, returns `summary`, `results` JSON and `csvUrl`.
  - `/api/download?file=` — safe file serve (or simply use public folder).
- Playwright integration: backend uses Playwright (Chromium) headless to open pages and extract title + first paragraph. Include robust extraction fallback: if no <p> found, extract first 200-300 chars of visible text.
- CSV generation: use `csv-writer` or `papaparse` server-side to create a downloadable CSV.
- Frontend:
  - `pages/index` — Landing page with hero, features, CTA, and the attached icon used in header.
  - `pages/chat` — Chat UI with message list, input box, attachments, and a “Search & Summarize” special action button. Show progress/status when agent runs.
  - Components: `Header`, `Footer`, `ChatWidget`, `AgentResults` (show table + CSV link), `MathSteps` (render step-by-step math).
- Assets: `public/algebrix-icon.png` (use attached icon). Favicon metadata included.
- README.md: full instructions to run locally and to deploy on Replit, list of required env vars:
  - `GEMINI_API_KEY_FREE` — free Gemini API key.
  - `PORT` — optional.
  - `NODE_ENV` — optional.
- package.json scripts:
  - `start`, `dev`, `build`, `postinstall` (runs `playwright install`).
- Unit/Integration: add at least one test script or manual test instructions for the `/api/agent` flow.

AI BEHAVIOR & PROMPTING (backend)
- When calling the Gemini API for searches, send a system prompt instructing Gemini to return the top 10 search URLs with short relevance scores and short descriptions.
- For each URL, Playwright should:
  1. Open page with a short timeout (10s).  
  2. Wait for `domcontentloaded`.  
  3. Remove common clutter selectors (cookie banners, overlays) if present.  
  4. Extract `<title>` and the first visible `<p>` or the first 250 chars of visible text.  
  5. Return `{ url, title, excerpt }`.
- After extracting 5 results, compose a concise summary (3–5 sentences) that synthesizes findings and includes a 1-line “confidence” note.
- For math/chat queries: use the Gemini API with a system prompt that instructs: “Show step-by-step solutions, show intermediate arithmetic (digit-by-digit) for any calculations, and present final answer clearly. Do not reveal internal chain-of-thought; present only clear steps and results.”

UI/UX SPECIFICS
- Chat widget:
  - Messages from user and Algebrix with distinct styles.
  - Agent messages can include:
    - Inline table of results (url + title + excerpt) and a prominent **Download CSV** button.
    - A short synth summary.
  - For “Search & Summarize” actions, show a real-time progress indicator: Searching → Extracting pages → Generating CSV → Done.
  - Include a safety notice modal that explains agent limits (no logins).
- Landing page copy: Use the provided German description (Algebrix.ai Beta – Beschreibung) as the “About” text and provide a short English tagline: “Autonomous. Intelligent. Everywhere. Your personal AI research and math assistant.”
- Use the attached `algebrix-icon.png` in header and as favicon. If icon not found, add `public/algebrix-icon.png` placeholder and add a TODO to replace.

DEPLOYMENT (Replit)
- README must include:
  1. How to create a Replit project and import the repo.
  2. Add environment variable `GEMINI_API_KEY_FREE` in the Replit secrets.
  3. Run `npm install` then `npx playwright install` (or `playwright install` in postinstall).
  4. Start the server with `npm run dev` or `npm start`.
  5. If headless browsers are restricted on Replit, include a fallback server-only path that uses HTTP fetch to get page HTML and extract title/first-paragraph if Playwright cannot run, and instruct the user how to toggle fallback mode via env var `PLAYWRIGHT_ENABLED=false`.
- Add instructions to ensure Playwright Chromium is installed in Replit environment (use `playwright install --with-deps` if necessary) and how to enable the necessary apt packages if Replit supports them.

DELIVERABLES
- Full project tree and all source files (complete and runnable).
- `README.md` with run & deploy instructions including Replit specifics and explanation of API endpoints.
- A short demo script with sample queries:
  - “Search for ‘best budget laptops 2025’ and summarize top 5 results.”
  - “Solve: 3x + 5 = 20. Show step-by-step work.”
- Add comments and TODOs where the developer must insert the real `GEMINI_API_KEY_FREE` and where to replace the icon if missing.

SAFETY & PRIVACY
- The site must explicitly state in the footer and in chat UI that Algebrix will never request user account credentials and will not perform any purchase or login actions.
- Rate limit agent runs to avoid abuse (e.g., max 2 concurrent agent tasks per IP; the backend should enforce this).

FINAL NOTE
- Provide a complete ZIP-ready project output and a single-page `README.md` that a user can paste into Replit, set the env var, run `npm install` and `npm run dev`, and see a working landing page and chat with basic agent functionality.
- If any steps fail due to environment constraints (e.g., Playwright not supported), add a clear fallback plan as described above.
